[5x6]
# different ways to create an object [4]

- Object Literal:	Simple, quick object creation.
- Object Constructor:	Rarely used, outdated.
- Constructor Function:	For creating multiple similar objects (pre-ES6).
- Classes:	Modern, cleaner way to create multiple objects.
- Object.create():	Create objects with custom prototypes.
- Factory Function:	Encapsulation and modularity.
- JSON Parsing:	When data comes in JSON format.
- Object.assign():	Combine or clone objects.
- Spread Operator:	Cleaner syntax for cloning or merging objects.

# How do you add a method to an existing object [6]

- Dot and Bracket Notation: Simple and direct for adding a method to a single object.
- Object.defineProperty(): For fine-grained control over property behavior.
- Prototype: For adding methods shared across all instances of an object.
- Class: For object-oriented programming.
- Spread and Object.assign(): For creating a new object with added methods.

# What is the difference between dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]) when accessing object properties [3]

- Dot Notation (.)
The most common and straightforward way to access an objectâ€™s property.
The property name must be a valid JavaScript identifier (e.g., no spaces, special characters, or numbers at the beginning).
- Bracket Notation ([])
A more flexible way to access properties, especially when the property name is dynamic, contains special characters, or is stored as a string.

# How do you use object destructuring to assign variables with different names than the object properties? [6]

- Object destructuring is a feature introduced in ES6 that allows you to unpack properties from objects into distinct variables in a concise and readable manner.This is done by using a colon (:) followed by the new variable name.
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30
};

// Renaming the properties during destructuring
const { name: fullName, age: yearsOld } = person;

console.log(fullName); // Output: Alice
console.log(yearsOld); // Output: 30

# Explain the concept of immutability in JavaScript objects. [2]

- Immutability in JavaScript refers to the concept where data cannot be modified after it is created. Instead of directly changing the values of objects or arrays, new objects or arrays are created with updated values.

# How would you deeply clone an object in JavaScript? [0]

- A deep clone creates a completely independent copy of an object or array, including all nested structures.
- Changes to nested objects or arrays in the copy do not affect the original, as they are fully duplicated.
- To deeply clone an object in JavaScript, you can use:
  - JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify()
  - Recursive Function
  - structuredClone()
  - Lodash's cloneDeep()

[2x2.5]
# What is the purpose of the hasOwnProperty method in JavaScript? [0]

- The hasOwnProperty method is a reliable way to check whether a property belongs directly to an object and not its prototype.

# How can you remove a property from an object? [2.5]

- by using delete operator.

# coding: 
1. Write a function that takes this array as input and returns an object with role-wise counts [0/10]
input:
const employees = [
  { name: "Alice", role: "Developer" },
  { name: "Bob", role: "Manager" },
  { name: "Charlie", role: "Designer" },
  { name: "David", role: "Developer" },
  { name: "Eve", role: "Manager" }
];
output:
{
  Developer: 2,
  Manager: 2,
  Designer: 1
}

let roleCount = {};

employees.forEach((emp) => {
  const role = emp.role;
  roleCount[role]  = (roleCount[role] || 0) + 1
})

console.log(roleCount)

# count letter
const name = "aalia";
let freqCount = {};

for(let i = 0; i < name.length; i++) {
  freqCount[name[i]] = (freqCount[name[i]] || 0) + 1;
}
console.log(freqCount)

# count unique letter
const name = "aalia";
let freqCount = {};
let ans = "";

for(let i = 0; i < name.length; i++) {
  if(freqCount[name[i]]) continue
  ans += name[i]
  freqCount[name[i]] = true;
}
console.log(ans)

2. Write a function that combines these objects into a single user object for authentication and profile details. [10/10]
input:
const authenticationData = {
  username: "user123",
  password: "securepassword"
};
const profileData = {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  age: 28
};
output:
{
  username: "user123",
  password: "securepassword",
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  age: 28
}
answer:
const result = {
  username: authenticationData.username,
  password: authenticationData.password,
  name: profileData.name,
  email: profileData.email,
  age: profileData.age,
};
console.log(result);

3. You have a large dataset of items, and you need to implement pagination.  [0/20]
Write a function that takes this data as input and returns an array representing the items on the current page.
input:
allItems = [
  { id: 1, name: "Laptop", category: "Electronics", price: 1200 },
  { id: 2, name: "Headphones", category: "Electronics", price: 100 },
  { id: 3, name: "Book", category: "Books", price: 20 },
  { id: 4, name: "Smartphone", category: "Electronics", price: 800 },
  { id: 5, name: "Backpack", category: "Fashion", price: 50 },
  { id: 6, name: "Watch", category: "Fashion", price: 150 },
  { id: 7, name: "Desk Chair", category: "Furniture", price: 200 },
  { id: 8, name: "Plant", category: "Home & Garden", price: 30 },
  { id: 9, name: "Gaming Console", category: "Electronics", price: 300 },
  { id: 10, name: "Running Shoes", category: "Fashion", price: 80 },
  { id: 11, name: "Coffee Table", category: "Furniture", price: 120 },
  { id: 12, name: "Television", category: "Electronics", price: 1000 },
  { id: 13, name: "Cookbook", category: "Books", price: 25 },
  { id: 14, name: "Sofa", category: "Furniture", price: 500 },
  { id: 15, name: "Fitness Tracker", category: "Electronics", price: 60 },
  { id: 16, name: "Artificial Plant", category: "Home & Garden", price: 15 },
  { id: 17, name: "Dining Table", category: "Furniture", price: 300 },
  { id: 18, name: "Bluetooth Speaker", category: "Electronics", price: 70 },
  { id: 19, name: "Novel", category: "Books", price: 18 },
  { id: 20, name: "Bedside Lamp", category: "Home & Garden", price: 40 },
];
itemsPerPage = 3
currentPage = 2;
output:
[
  { id: 4, name: 'Smartphone', category: 'Electronics', price: 800 },
  { id: 5, name: 'Backpack', category: 'Fashion', price: 50 },
  { id: 6, name: 'Watch', category: 'Fashion', price: 150 }
]

// let currentPage = 3;
// const itemsPerPage = 3;

function pagination(currentPage, itemsPerPage) {
  let startIndex = (currentPage-1)*itemsPerPage;
  const pageItems = allItems.slice(startIndex, (itemsPerPage+startIndex));
console.log(pageItems);
}

pagination(7, 3);
