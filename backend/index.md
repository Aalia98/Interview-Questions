# What is backend ?

The backend of a web application is the server-side component that handles data processing, business logic, database interactions, and overall functionality that users don't directly see. It is responsible for:

- Server-Side Logic: Processing requests from the frontend (e.g., login, form submissions) and generating responses.
- Database Interaction: Storing, retrieving, and managing data in databases like MySQL or MongoDB.
- APIs: Providing interfaces for the frontend to communicate with the backend.
- Security: Handling authentication, authorization, and protecting against threats.
- Business Logic: Implementing the core functionality (e.g., order processing, payment handling).
- Performance: Managing caching, load balancing, and efficient data handling.
