# What is the internet, and how does it work?

- The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that communicate using standardized protocols like TCP/IP. It allows users to share information, access services, and interact globally.
- When a user requests information (e.g., entering a URL in a browser), the request is sent through a series of routers to a server hosting the requested data. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates the human-readable domain name into an IP address to locate the server. Data is broken into packets, transmitted across the network, and reassembled at the destination. Protocols like HTTP and HTTPS define how data is exchanged, while physical infrastructure such as cables, routers, and servers ensures connectivity. This entire process happens in milliseconds, enabling seamless global communication and data sharing.

# What is the difference between the internet and the World Wide Web?

- The internet is the physical network that connects devices worldwide, while the World Wide Web is a service on the internet that uses browsers and protocols (like HTTP) to access websites and information.

# Explain the role of an IP address in internet communication.

- An IP address (Internet Protocol address) plays a crucial role in internet communication by uniquely identifying devices (computers, smartphones, servers) on a network. It acts as the "address" that allows devices to locate and communicate with each other.

# What is DNS, and why is it important for the internet?

- The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the phone book of the internet. It translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 142.250.190.78) that computers use to locate and communicate with each other over the internet.
- DNS is essential for the internet because it simplifies web navigation, ensures seamless communication, and provides a scalable and secure way to connect users to resources. Without DNS, accessing websites would require memorizing numerical IP addresses.

# What is a URL? Break it down into its components.

- A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access resources (web pages, files, etc.) on the internet. It specifies the location of a resource and the method (protocol) to access it, containing components like protocol, domain, port, path, query, and fragment. Each part serves a unique role in locating and interacting with the resource.
