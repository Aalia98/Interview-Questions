# What is HTTP/HTTPS? How are they different?

- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundational protocol used to transfer data between a web browser (client) and a server.

- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an enhanced version of HTTP that encrypts the data exchanged between the browser and the server using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security). It is more secure than the HTTP.

# Explain the purpose of the TCP/IP protocol.

- The TCP/IP protocol is the backbone of internet communication, ensuring reliable, accurate, and efficient data transfer between devices on the internet. It facilitates interoperability, error handling, and scalability, making it fundamental to networking.

# What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) while	UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked communication, making it ideal for critical applications. UDP prioritizes speed and low latency over reliability, making it suitable for time-sensitive and real-time scenarios.

# How does FTP (File Transfer Protocol) work?

- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server over a network, such as the internet. It supports uploading, downloading, deleting, and managing files on a remote server.

- FTP Works operates in a client-server architecture with two main communication channels:
  - Control Connection: Used to send commands (like login credentials or file requests) and receive responses between the client and the server.
  - Data Connection:Used to transfer the actual file data (uploads or downloads).

# What is the role of ICMP in the internet?

- ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is a network layer protocol used for sending error messages and operational information about network conditions.
- ICMP plays a vital role in diagnosing, managing, and maintaining the internet by reporting errors, testing connectivity, and monitoring network performance. It ensures efficient communication and helps resolve network-related issues quickly.
